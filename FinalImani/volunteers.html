            Our Undergraduate Volunteers are the work-force behind Imani's operations. They are routinely in Saturday clinics and are equipped to provide adequate patient care. There are several roles that undergraduates embody including Intake, Lab technician, Translators, EMR Specialist, and Receptionist. In addition to the clinic, Imani strives to build a community relationship through our outreaching efforts. Volunteers are highly involved within the community through our partnership with YXP and local community organizations. We are thankful for the students who have chosen to dedicate their time and efforts to Imani Clinic.
