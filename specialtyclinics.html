                <p class="paragraphBody"><br>Who We Are: The Imani (Health) Clinic is the result of the labor and efforts of UC Davis medical students in the Student National Medical Association (SNMA), an organization dedicated to improving the medical, academic, and social outcomes of the Black community.<br>
                Our clinic opened on October 22, 1994, and was founded in the heart of the Oak Park neighborhood, where over 57% of the population were part of a minority group, 80% of the community were classified as working poor or unemployed, and a majority lacked health insurance and access to health education and care.<br>
                With the same impetus to service the Black and other underserved populations in the area, the Imani Legal Clinic was established in 2015 as a part of the Imani (Health) Clinic specialty clinic services. Since 2015, Imani legal Clinic has provided patients with free consultations on housing issues, health insurance, and immigration services.<br>
                Mission: To advocate for and empower members of the Black communities of Oak Park by enhancing access to legal services, referrals, and programs.<br>
                Vision: To meld social justice and legal advocacy and prioritize the community, social, and cultural, needs of the Black community.<br>
                Our Goals:<br>
                To provide legal advocacy, social justice education, and community empowerment programming to an underserved community without regard to address (or lack of one), national/ethnic origin, immigration status, language, religion, or ability to pay.<br>
                To expand the presence of Imani Legal Clinic – and the Imani Clinic overall – within the Oak Park/Sacramento area.<br>
                To be of service with intention and insight regarding the social needs of the Black community.<br>
                To foster early and lasting relationships between the community, the Imani Legal Clinic, and legal professionals.<br>

                <center><strong>Every 2nd Saturday</strong></center>
                <p class="paragraphBody"><br>The Imani Cardiology Clinic is a specialty clinic within our routine primary care operations here at Imani. Our cardiology clinic is in direct response to an internal patient survey addressing the increasing demand and gap in health care coverage for cardiology services. Internal and external audits found that patients within the network of student run clinics at the UC Davis School of Medicine’s regularly present with cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. The focus of our cardiology clinic is to prevent, reduce, and manage risk factors associated with heart disease within the underserved communities of the Sacramento area.<br>Our team can provide consultations for patients presenting with existing diagnoses of coronary artery disease, heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrythmias, and other cardiovascular complications. We do not perform interventional procedures nor are we able to provide emergency services. Diagnostic electrocardiograms with interpretation can also be performed for patients presenting with chest pain, unstable angina, or similar symptoms. For patients needing specified care with increased scheduling frequency, the network of preceptors and medical students here at Imani clinic can provide supplemental coverage between cardiology clinics. Patient specific educational material and risk analysis can also be provided by IHEOP (Imani Health Education and Outreach Program).<br>Cardiology clinic is held on the second Saturday of every month admitting from 8am to 12pm. If you believe you or your patient would benefit from seeing our cardiology team at Imani, please review and complete the referral sheet attached at the bottom of the page and submit to the cardiology clinic coordinator Eliseo Vazquez at etvazquez@ucdavis.edu with the title (Cardiology Clinic-Patient Name-Referring Clinic, if applicable) for scheduling. If you or your patient need next available scheduling, we encourage you to call our clinic phone at (916) 475-9582. Walk ins are welcome and we highly suggest patients bring any medical records with them (e.g. current prescriptions, laboratory results or discharge notes).<br>We accept all patients regardless of health insurance or residency status. We also offer referrals for services that we cannot provide. Our clinic interpreters are available to accompany Spanish speaking patients. Regular clinic hours are Saturdays from 8am to 2pm. <br>                Cardio Referral Form: http://nebula.wsimg.com/9387fbbb6005783c36bafd88616703e1?AccessKeyId=B1C68CC3ACA559E94E65&disposition=0&alloworigin=1</p>

                <center><strong>Every 4th Saturday</strong></center>
                <p class="paragraphBody"><br>At Imani's Dermatology Clinic patients are seen for a variety of conditions. Some of the most common services offered include consultations for skin, hair, and nails, check ups on conditions such as moles, warts, rashes, eczema, and conditions regarding fungal/bacterial infections. Another important service are screenings for skin cancer, where early detection is vital. Dr. Samuel Hwang, head of the Dermatology at the UC Davis Medical Center, is the lead preceptor for Imani’s Dermatology Clinic. Thanks to Dr. Hwang, Imani’s Dermatology Clinic will soon have biopsy instruments that will be able to collect skin samples for better skin cancer screening and overall better dermatology services to the Oak Park Community.</p>
