            <p><b>Imani</b>, a Swahili word meaning "faith", was selected partially for the African philosophy of community embodied in the principles of Kwanzaa, an African-American year-end tradition. The word also represents the faith that we as students have in the strength and worthiness of our communities, as well as the faith we hope to foster within those communities of the ability of the health care system to address their medical needs and social realities. </p>

                <br>The Imani Cardiology Clinic is in direct response to an internal patient survey addressing the increasing demand and gap in health care coverage for cardiology services. The focus of our cardiology clinic is to prevent, reduce, and manage risk factors associated with heart disease within the underserved communities of the Sacramento area.<br>
                <br>Our team can provide consultations for patients with the following diagnoses:<br>
                <br>1. Coronary artery disease 
                <br>2. Heart failure
                <br>3. Myocardial infarction
                <br>4. Rrythmias
                <br>5. Other cardiovascular complications<br>
                <br>We do not perform interventional procedures nor are we able to provide emergency services. Diagnostic electrocardiograms with interpretation can also be performed for patients presenting with chest pain, unstable angina, or similar symptoms. For patients needing specified care with increased scheduling frequency, the network of preceptors and medical students here at Imani clinic can provide supplemental coverage between cardiology clinics. Patient specific educational material and risk analysis can also be provided by IHEOP (Imani Health Education and Outreach Program). <br>
                <br>If you believe you or your patient would benefit from seeing our cardiology team at Imani, please review and complete the referral sheet attached at the bottom of the page and submit to the cardiology clinic coordinator Eliseo Vazquez at etvazquez@ucdavis.edu with the title Cardiology Clinic-Patient Name-Referring Clinic, if applicable, for scheduling. If you or your patient needs next available scheduling, we encourage you to call our clinic phone at (916) 475-9582. Walk-ins are welcome and we highly suggest patients to bring any medical records with them (e.g. current prescriptions, laboratory results or discharge notes). <br>
                <br>We accept all patients regardless of health insurance or residency status. We also offer referrals for services that we cannot provide. Our clinic interpreters are available to accompany Spanish speaking patients.<br>
